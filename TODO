== Fix --patternxml with multiple patterns in single file ==

Decide what to do when there are multiple patterns in single .yaml file and
when user is creating patternxml instead of groupxml. Currently output of 
test5 with --patternxml is broken see tests/data/patterns/test5.yaml as it 
looses the second pattern.
